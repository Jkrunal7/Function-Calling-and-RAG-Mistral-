# Function Calling and RAG with Mistral

This project encompasses two powerful applications using Mistral AI:

1. RAG with Mistral AI:
This implementation extracts blog content from a provided URL, processes it by chunking, embedding, and storing the embeddings in a FAISS database. The system then performs Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to retrieve relevant information from the database and generate context-aware responses.

**Key Features:**

**_RAG with Mistral AI:_**

- **URL Content Extraction:** Extracts the entire blog content from a provided URL.
- **Chunking and Embedding:** Breaks down the content into smaller chunks, converts them into embeddings, and stores them in a FAISS database.
- **RAG Model:** Performs RAG using the stored embeddings to generate responses based on the extracted blog content.


2. Function Calling with Mistral:
This part demonstrates function calling with Mistral AI to interact with a database containing transaction data. Two functions, retrieve_payment_status and retrieve_payment_dates, are used to extract specific information (payment status and payment dates) from the transaction database based on the provided query parameters.

**Key Features:**

_**Function Calling with Mistral:**_

- **Database Integration:** Uses a transactional database with columns such as transaction_id, customer_id, payment_amount, payment_date, and payment_status.
- **Function Calling:** Defines two functions (retrieve_payment_status and retrieve_payment_dates) to extract specific details from the database.
- **Dynamic Querying:** Functions are invoked dynamically to retrieve information based on transaction data.
